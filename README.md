**Don't want miss the opportunity to visit our Zoo where we'll provide you with a list of your favourite animals** :rabbit: :eagle:

---
The website is built in a way that gives the user an easy way to set a list in where he can add the animals to it and afterwards, can check or uncheck if he had visited the animals in our Zoo or not.Furthermore,if he had any errors in typing his animal he can easily delete that from his list.In adition,if he didnt type anything the website will alert him to type a text.Also, if the animal name is already in the list the user won't be able to add it to the list again.

## User Story

## Project Goals

* Designing an interactive website which aim to make visiting list of animals more easier by entering an animal name into a text box,where you can delete every Animal you saw or  mark it as a done. 

* We interact with html/css/javascript and DOM all together

* Testing our functions by using TDD method
